***Definitions:***

- The Infrastructure is a Terraform configuration that provisions a virtual machine on Digital Ocean Cloud.
- The Domain is `tjazerzen.com`, managed on Cloudflare.
- The DNS Record maps The Domain to The Virtual Machine's IP address.
- The Security Group is an Digital Ocean security group that allows SSH (port 22) and HTTP/HTTPS (ports 80, 443).
- The TLS Certificates are issued by Let's Encrypt and managed using Cloudflare API.
- The Cloud-Init Script is responsible for setting up The Virtual Machine with required software.

***Non-Functional Requirements:***

- The Infrastructure should be written in Terraform.
- The Cloud-Init Script should be used to install and configure Nginx and Docker.
- The Security Group should be managed in Digital Ocean.
- The DNS Record should be managed using Cloudflare's API.
- SSL certificates should be automatically provisioned with Let's Encrypt.

***Test Requirements:***

- Use BATS (Bash Automated Testing System) to validate the following:
  - The Virtual Machine is reachable via SSH.
  - Nginx is running and accessible on HTTP (port 80).
  - The DNS Record resolves to the Virtual Machine's IP.
  - The SSL certificate is valid.
  
***Functional Requirements:***

- Provision a Virtual Machine on Digital Ocean Cloud.
- Assign a public IP to The Virtual Machine.
- Create a Cloudflare DNS Record pointing to The Virtual Machine.
- Attach The Security Group to allow SSH (port 22) and HTTP/HTTPS (ports 80, 443).
- Deploy Cloud-Init Script on The Virtual Machine to install Nginx and Docker.
- Use Let's Encrypt with Cloudflare API for TLS Certificates.
- Output the Virtual Machine IP and DNS Record for verification.
- Write a README.md file that explains how to run the application and setup the environment.
