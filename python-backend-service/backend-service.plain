***Definitions:***

- The Server is an API server built with FastAPI.

- The Master API Key is stored in a .env file as MASTER_API_KEY. 

***Non-Functional Requirements:***

- The implementation must use Python with FastAPI.

- The Master API Key should be loaded using dotenv.

- The project should use requirements.txt for package management.

- Requests should be logged using print.

- The project should have separate folders for unit and e2e tests: `tests/unit/`, `tests/e2e/`

- packages should be managed with venv, python version 3.13

***Test Requirements:***

- Unit tests should be written using pytest.

- End-to-end tests should be implemented using httpx. 

***Functional Requirements:***

- Implement the entry point for The Server.

- Implement a GET endpoint at /hello-world. You should return a JSON object with a message and status code 200.

- Authenticate the request using the Master API Key. If not authenticated, return a 401 status code.

- Write a README.md file that explains how to run the application and setup the environment. It should include instructions for creating venv, installing dependencies, running the tests, and starting the server.
